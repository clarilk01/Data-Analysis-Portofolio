# Gel Performance Monitoring Tool

## Project Overview
A real-time monitoring system for chromatography column performance that helps process operators make maintenance decisions based on multiple KPIs.

## Business Problem
Chromatography columns gradually degrade during operation, leading to:
- Reduced separation efficiency
- Increased pressure drops
- Potential product loss
- Unplanned downtime

## Solution
An automated monitoring tool that:
- Continuously analyzes 4 critical KPIs
- Calculates a composite performance score
- Provides early warnings for maintenance
- Suggests when to repack or fluidize columns

## Technical Features
- Real-time data processing (simulated)
- Multi-parameter performance scoring
- Automated alert system
- Interactive dashboard for operators
- Trend analysis for predictive maintenance

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for normalization)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib/Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
- Simulated real-time data pipeline
